The objective of this assignment is to use a large data set with multiple input variables to predict their associated target variables. 

This can be accomplished by creating a linear model that associates weights with each variable along with a bias. After the weights are trained and the model is made, the accuracy of the model can be measured by the root-mean-squared error (RMSE). A model that models the target variables more accurately will have a smaller RMSE, hence, the objective is to minimize the root-mean-squared error.
