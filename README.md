# Machine-Learning-Projects
These are some ML projects I have completed. They heavily draw from CS 445 Intro to ML that I took at CSU in Spring 2018. Each folder is a separate project. Overview of each project is in the jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) and supporting code might be in python files (.py)
